huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...
To disable this warning, you can either:
	- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
	- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

 I'm really nervous about this upcoming presentation at work. Public speaking just isn't my thing, and I'm worried I'll mess it up. How can I calm my nerves and do well?
assistant
 First of all, it's totally normal to feel nervous about public speaking. Even the most seasoned speakers get butterflies sometimes. The key is to channel that nervous energy into excitement and preparation.
user
 That's a good point. I have been preparing a lot, practicing my slides and my talking points. But in the moment, I'm afraid my mind will just go blank.
assistant
 I totally get that fear. One thing that can help is to focus on your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths before you start and during your presentation if you need to center yourself. It's also helpful to remember that your audience is rooting for you. They want to see you succeed!
user
 You're right, they're not out to get me. I think I also put a lot of pressure on myself to be perfect. But realistically, a minor slip-up isn't the end of the world, right?
assistant
 Exactly! Perfection is overrated. If you stumble over a word or lose your place for a moment, just take a breath and keep going. Your passion for your topic will shine through. And remember, you know your stuff! You've got the knowledge and preparation to crush this presentation. I believe in you, and I know you're going to do amazing. You've so got this, girl! 🙌
